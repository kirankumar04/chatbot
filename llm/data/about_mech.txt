Welcome to the Department of Mechanical Engineering—a vibrant space where innovation, scientific inquiry, and practical application converge. Since our inception in 2012, we have been committed to fostering a learning ecosystem that not only imparts strong theoretical foundations but also emphasizes the practical skills required by today’s industries. Our dedication to excellence was recognized when we achieved NBA accreditation within just five years of establishment—an achievement made possible by our unwavering focus on Outcome-Based Education (OBE).

At the heart of our department’s academic philosophy is OBE, ensuring that every course and project is aligned with clearly defined learning outcomes. Our faculty members design and continuously refine the curriculum so that each student develops the technical competencies, critical-thinking abilities, and professional attributes essential for success in modern engineering spheres. Through hands-on projects, laboratory work, and interactive sessions, students gain exposure to the complete lifecycle of mechanical systems—from concept and design to manufacturing and operation.

To further empower our students, we offer extensive trainings in contemporary and emerging areas of mechanical engineering. Our high-end Simulation Laboratory, CNC Laboratory, and R&D Laboratory serve as hubs for experiential learning. Students receive specialized instruction in CAD, CAM, Robotics, Welding, and NDT, among many other areas, so they graduate ready to meet the evolving demands of a variety of sectors—Automobile, Aerospace, Energy, and beyond.

Equally important, we believe in nurturing a culture of self-learning and professional growth. Our faculty members are constantly updating their expertise through research, publications, and active participation in professional bodies. This commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements ensures that our students not only gain current knowledge but also develop the aptitude for lifelong learning—critical for engineers aspiring to be leaders in industry and research.

I invite you to explore the programs, projects, and initiatives that make our department a thriving environment for personal and professional development. Join us in our mission to produce ethical, industry-ready mechanical engineers who can confidently address real-world challenges and shape the future with innovation and integrity.
